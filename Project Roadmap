Create one PowerPoint slide introducing
your project and upload it. If you have more than one teammate, each needs to
turn-in a copy in D2L to ensure everyone has a copy and gets credit. The slide
needs to be attractive and informative. Be sure to include this information:
List your project team members.
Show the title of your project.
Show a tag line that introduces the main concept of what it does/will do.
Show 1-2 screenshots or pictures demonstrating the idea or parts (optional) Each
person must upload a PPT slide in D2L. Each team must ensure there is a copy in
their Github repository so that future coders can quickly grasp the idea

evaluating seed code:
possible changes:
File Path Handling:The file path 'Pillbox_production.csv' is hardcoded, which could lead to errors if the file is not in the working directory.
CSV Reading and Line Counting:The line_count variable is used to differentiate between the header row and data rows, which is a good approach. However, you can use next(csv_reader) instead to skip the header row without needing line_count.
String Capitalization:Using upper() and capitalize() inconsistently may produce undesired effects in fields like shape and score.
Unused Code and Comments:There are unused comments (like # '/home/vagrant/src/hb_pillproject/pill_testing_book.csv') that clutter the code.
Repeated print Statements:print statements are used for debugging. If this script runs in production, these statements should be removed or replaced with proper logging.
