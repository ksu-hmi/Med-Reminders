# Med-Reminders
This would be an application that supplies medication reminders with a connection to EHR systems. Therefore providers and those given permission to view medical information
can see the patients medication intake. Notifications would be given to the guardians, family, and providers if the patient is overtaking or undertaking the medication
to ensure adequate treatment and action can be taken in those cases.

The pharmacy would scan a QR code on the prescription before giving it to the patient for it to be input into the app to begin giving reminders. 
This information would include dosage, frequency, weight, etc.
Ideally, the prescription bottle would have smart technology to lock in between dosage times to ensure the patient is not overtaking the medication. 
This smart bottle would also weigh the contents of the medication to be able to track the number of pills in the container.

This would be useful for those with Dementia, Alzheimers, Nuerological problems that want to maintain control over their medicial conditions.
Nursing Homes, Senior Living, and Assisted Living centers could use this to  better track patient intake of medications and make sure patients are not overtaking or undertaking their medications. There are many cases of drug interactions in these facilities that could be solved by knowing medication intake for patients. 

This could would require the input of a medication name, dosage amount, weight of each pill, the frequency of medication, provider name, and EHR system name.
There will be define functions, if/else/elif statements, inputs, while/break loops, etc in the code which will aid in inputting user information and 
making sure that the information is accepted. 

I could use help with coding the QR Code connection to bring up the prescription on the app.
